# Fulcrum Postman Collection

This is just a simple export from Postman that was created by Importing from [Fulcrum Swagger Docs JSON](https://api.scale.smsturbo.com/swagger/v2/swagger.json)

We can update this by simply pulling the JSON and importing to Postman then exporting and uploading directly to Github.

The general purpose is to have something to give to customers who want a sample of the API to use in Postman that we know works

The varibles are located in the top level of the postman collection.
